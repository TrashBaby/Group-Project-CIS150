//CIS150-01 - Team Purple Turtle Turtles
//Start date: 11/12/2017
//Description: This game is designed to create a maze for the user to run through. The maze walls will be invisibile, and the
// user has the posibility of running into bombs that will end their life and extra lifes which will add an addition life
// to their life counter. Finishing the first level will allow the user to move on to the next level, where the size of the
// maze and number of items increases.


//10 levels in difficulty, more bombs and more coins, set bomb spawn points per level so we have a kay map to use
//level 1: 3x3 maze, 1 bomb, 1 coin
//level 2: exponential increaming, number of bombs = number of coins, bomb ratio is 3 boms to 1 coin
//bombs are not displayed to user, but the number of bombs will be told to the user
//pro level: coin surrounded by bombs except on one side, one way in one way out
//potentially bombs moving with every user move
//text file: saving player names and scores in a text file, old school arcade style high score list


// This is the note section for the project, I'm thinking we'll post notes to each other as neseccary here to
// make it clear and obvivous if something important was changed/added.
